# Git-Homework
In this repository, I performed the corresponding Git Class assignment.

In this homework it is necessary:
- Investigate what is a pull request.
- Investigate what is a conflict and how to solve it.
- Create a remote repository (This) in which on the timeline you can see: at least 1 commit, 1 branch, 1 pull request and 3 different files.
